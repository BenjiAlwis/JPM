Set-Up

	1. Before you can tackle any software development task, you need to set up your development environment. You can think of your local development environment as a virtual 	workbench with all the tools necessary to work on your project. To set up your dev environment, follow the following instructions:
	2. Install python 3 to your system - any recent version of python 3 will work fine, though the most up-to-date version is advisable. If you need help with this step, check out this excellent guide from real python: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
	3. Fork and clone the starter repo here: https://github.com/vagabond-systems/jpmc-task-1
	4. Open the project in your IDE of choice - if you don’t have a favourite python IDE yet, take a look at Pycharm Community Edition. It’s a well-designed IDE by Jetbrains packed with features and plugins, powerful enough to work on the most complex projects, and entirely free.
	5. Create a new virtual environment in the project root. Pycharm can do this automatically for you using the “configure python interpreter” option in settings.
	6. Install all project dependencies. These are listed in the requirements.txt file.
